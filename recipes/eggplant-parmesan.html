    <p>Cut the eggplant into 1/4-inch slices (or slightly thicker, but no thinner). 
    Sprinkle with salt and place in a colander while you measure out remaining ingredients.</p>
    <p>Place each slice in between paper towels and press down to absorb all excess moisture. 
    Dredge in flour, egg, and breadcrumb mixtures.</p>
    <p>Preheat oil in a large skillet. 
    Add the eggplant and fry in batches until crispy on each side.
    Transfer on a wire cooling rack. 
    Spread marinara sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish and layer with one-third of the eggplant. 
    Top each slice with marinara sauce and cheese.</p>
    <p>Repeat the same layers two more times. (Eggplant, marinara sauce, cheese.) 
    Bake uncovered at 375° for 25-30 minutes.</p>
